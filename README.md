### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Flutter SDK**: Download and install Flutter by following the [official instructions](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
- **Dart SDK**: You do not need to install Dart separately as the Flutter SDK includes the full Dart SDK.
- **Android Studio** or **Visual Studio Code**: Choose one of these development editors and install the Flutter and Dart plugins.

### Steps to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository**  
   Clone the project to your working directory. Open the terminal and use the following command, replacing `your-username` and `your-repo-name`:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fabranx/Expensy.git

### Additional Notes

## How To Import Expenses via Excel

To import your expenses into the app using an Excel file, follow these steps:

1. **Row 0: Column Titles**  
   In the first row (Row 0), insert the following titles, one for each column in this exact order:
    - `Date`
    - `Description`
    - `Amount`
    - `Currency`
    - `Tags`
    - `Payment-Account`

2. **Date Column**  
   In the `Date` column, enter the date of the expense. Make sure the date is formatted as a **date** in Excel.

3. **Description Column**  
   In the `Description` column, enter text describing the expense. If the cell is empty, the entire row will be skipped during import.

4. **Amount Column**  
   In the `Amount` column, enter a numeric value representing the amount spent. This can be a whole number or a decimal, and it must be zero or positive. If the value is invalid (negative, non-numeric, or empty), the entire row will be skipped.

5. **Currency Column**  
   In the `Currency` column, enter one of the following valid currencies. If an invalid or empty value is entered, the entire row will be skipped:
    - `USD`
    - `EUR`
    - `JPY`
    - `GBP`
    - `AUD`
    - `CAD`
    - `CHF`
    - `CNH`
    - `HKD`
    - `NZD`

6. **Tags Column**  
   In the `Tags` column, you can either leave the cell empty or enter text representing one or more tags for the expense. If entering multiple tags, separate them using a semicolon (`;`). Example: `groceries;food`.

7. **Payment-Account Column**  
   In the `Payment-Account` column, you can either leave the cell empty or enter text representing a single payment account associated with the expense.

### Example Excel Layout

| Date       | Description       | Amount | Currency | Tags               | Payment-Account |
|------------|-------------------|--------|----------|--------------------|-----------------|
| 2024-01-15 | Grocery shopping   | 50.25  | USD      | groceries;food     | Credit Card     |
| 2024-01-16 | Monthly Rent       | 1200   | EUR      | rent               | Bank Transfer   |
| 2024-01-17 | Dinner at restaurant | 45.60  | GBP      | dining;entertainment | Debit Card      |

Once your Excel file is correctly formatted, you can proceed with the import process within the app.
